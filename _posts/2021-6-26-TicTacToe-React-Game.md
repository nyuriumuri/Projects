title: "TicTacToe Game Made With React"
category: Games
---
The game can be played [here](https://nyuriumuri.github.io/tictactoe-react-game).

This is a simple web app I made to familiarize myself with react. The game can be either played alone against an AI or with a second player. The AI uses a simple minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Source code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nyuriumuri/tictactoe-react-game/).
