>*The app can be found [here](https://nyuriumuri.github.io/DiceRoller/).*

I have been getting into TTRPGs lately, so I thought it might be fun if I could make my own dice roller with all the features I'd like to find in a (preferably free) app.
\
\
The app still needs a lot of work before I can consider it done. So far, you can roll any number of n-sided die and the app would count the sum, number of evens, or number of successes depending on the desired output. \
\
Successes are flexible and can be set to less than, greater than, or equal to any inputted value. \
\
Finally, there is also an option to have the dice explode whenever one reaches its maximum value.
