Thought it might be fun to create a guessing tool for Wordle, and somehow ended up spending most of my Friday on this little project. This definitely isn't the most effecient tool out there, but it somehow seems to work well enough. 

## How To use:

- Type the suggested word into wordle
- Click on each letter to change its colour between grey, yellow, and green
- Click on the blue ">>" to get the next guess
- Click on the red "X" to skip the current guess
