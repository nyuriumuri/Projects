2ahwa Ya Basha is an Egyptian 2ahwa simulator inspired by Diner Dash. You play as 3am Mohamed, the m3alem and sole employee of the 2ahwa.
\
\
 You have three tasks:
1. Take Customer Orders
2. Prepare Drinks
3. Serve Drinks and Tawla

The goal of the game is to reach 1000 EGP as quickly as possible. The catch is:  every drink you prepare consumes ingredients from your inventory.

At the end of each day, you'll get the chance to restock on ingredients, an act that will cost precious money. So spend wisely!
